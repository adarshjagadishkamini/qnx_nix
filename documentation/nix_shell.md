# Shell Environment Implementation (nix_shell.c)

## Overview
Provides isolated shell environments for profiles with controlled dependencies.

## Key Components

### Environment Setup
- `setup_environment()`: Configures clean environment
- `essential_utils`: List of required system utilities
- `find_store_path_for_util()`: Locates utilities in store

### Path Management
- Constructs isolated PATH variable
- Sets up LD_LIBRARY_PATH
- Preserves minimal environment variables
- Manages profile-specific paths

### Shell Execution
- Launches QNX shell with clean environment
- Preserves working directory
- Maintains essential variables:
  - HOME
  - USER
  - TERM
  - PATH
  - LD_LIBRARY_PATH

## Implementation Details

### Environment Isolation
- Clears inherited environment
- Sets minimal required variables
- Uses profile-specific libraries
- Maintains system utilities access

### Path Resolution
- Handles relative/absolute paths
- Resolves symbolic links
- Manages store path mapping
- Supports essential utilities

### Error Handling
- Validates profile existence
- Checks directory permissions
- Reports execution failures
- Preserves error messages
